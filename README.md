# East Tennessee Relic and Coin Hunters
## About

My first coding job! I created this site from scratch for a metal detecting club based in Tennessee.


## What I Learned From This Project

- Hosting: I was tasked with transferring the domain to a cheaper, more suitable hosting provider. I saved them $100 annualy.
- Email campaigns: I created the club multiple email newsletter templates via Mailchimp.
- Mailchimp Surveys: I created the club a membership form with Mailchimp's survey builder.
- Design: I had full creative freedom over the look of the site. I have no design background, so this was as challenging as it was exciting!  


## What I Enjoyed About Creating This

Professional experience! Creating a fully functional site to be used by others is the reason I enjoy web development.
